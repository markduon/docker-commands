## Several useful docker commands

Delete all images and containers
```
docker system prune -a
```

List all container (even with stopped ones)
```
docker container ls -a
```

### Example for an app architecture

```
python-docker
|____ app.py
|____ requirements.txt
|____ Dockerfile
```

### Basic steps to create a Dockerfile
A Dockerfile is a text document that contains all the commands a user could call on the command line to assemble an image. When we tell Docker to build our image by executing the `docker build` command, Docker reads these instructions and execute them consecutively and create a Docker image as a result.

The first line to add to the Dockerfile is a `# syntax` parser directive
```
# syntax=docker/dockerfile:1
```
We recommend using `docker/dockerfile:1`, which always points to the latest release of the version 1 syntax.

Next, we need to add a line in our Dockerfile that tells Docker what base image we would like to use for our application.
```
# syntax=docker/dockerfile:1

FROM ubuntu:18.04
```
Docker images can be inherited from other images. Therefore, instead of creating our own base image, weâ€™ll use the official ubuntu image that already has all the tools and packages that we need to run on ubuntu.

Then, we install pip3 and python-dev
```
RUN apt-get update -y && apt-get install -y python3-pip python-dev
```

When running or building, many files will be cached in `/var/lib/apt/lists/`. To delete files in cache
```
RUN rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*
```
This command should be run in the last RUN command.



<!-- Normally, to run an example (Flask), we use
```
python3 -m flask run
``` -->

# Remove docker completely from your system

To completely uninstall Docker from your Ubuntu system, follow these steps:

1. **Stop and remove all Docker containers**:
   ```bash
   docker stop $(docker ps -a -q)
   docker rm $(docker ps -a -q)
   ```

2. **Remove all Docker images**:
   ```bash
   docker rmi $(docker images -a -q)
   ```

3. **Remove all Docker networks**:
   ```bash
   docker network prune
   ```

4. **Remove Docker volumes and cache**:
   ```bash
   docker system prune -a
   ```

5. **Uninstall Docker packages**:
   ```bash
   sudo apt remove docker-* --auto-remove
   ```

6. **Remove leftover Docker files**:
   ```bash
   sudo rm -rf /var/lib/docker
   sudo rm -rf /var/run/docker.sock
   ```

7. **Remove the Docker group**:
   ```bash
   sudo groupdel docker
   ```
